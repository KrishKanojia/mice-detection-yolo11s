# mice-detection-yolo11s
This repository contains a YOLO11s object detection model trained on a custom mice dataset consisting of 8,000 annotated images.

The model has been exported into multiple formats for flexible deployment across different environments:

## Available Model Formats

1. PyTorch (training + inference)

2. OpenVINO (optimized for Intel hardware)

3. TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) (optimized for mobile & edge devices)

## Use Cases

Automated mice detection from camera
